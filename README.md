# 📘 Python Tasks: Dictionary Search & List Operations

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains two Python tasks designed to practice core Python concepts:

1. Searching elements in a dictionary
2. List slicing and reversing elements of a list

These tasks help in understanding data structures and basic Python operations.

## 🧠 Task 1: Searching in a Dictionary

### 🔍 Description

This task demonstrates how to search for a key in a dictionary and retrieve its corresponding value.

### ⚙️ Working

* A dictionary is created with key–value pairs.
* The user provides a key to search.
* The program checks:

  * If the key exists → its value is displayed.
  * If the key does not exist → a suitable message is shown.

### 💡 Concepts Used

* Python dictionaries
* Conditional statements
* User input
* Key existence checking

## 🧠 Task 2: List Slicing and Reversing

### 🔄 Description

This task focuses on slicing a list and reversing its elements using Python list operations.

### ⚙️ Working

* A list of elements is defined.
* List slicing is used to extract specific parts of the list.
* The list is reversed using slicing techniques.
* The original list and modified lists are displayed.

### 💡 Concepts Used

* Python lists
* List slicing
* Reverse indexing
* Basic list manipulation
